WEAPCO has many slaves in this system. If we free a large number of them, it might help to spark a rebellion movement.

Attacking the ore mines directly would be dangerous. You'd be better off intercepting slave transports. What you'll have to do is fly around and see if you can intercept a WEAPCO patrol. Of course, they might not be escorting any slave units, so be careful!

I estimate that we will need to rescue around 250 to make a difference.
