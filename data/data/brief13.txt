I've located my sister's ship currently in orbit around Odeon. She's ignoring my hails though.

Odeon's a heavy controlled WEAPCO research planet. Sounds like she's planning some mass destruction.
FACE_SID
I don't think so. I've just pin pointed her to be freely travelling with a WEAPCO flight group.
FACE_CHRIS
Sounds like your sister may have turned traitor.
FACE_SID
Sounds more like she's been brainwashed. WEAPCO were developing a new AI training program. We'd better rescue her!
