I've remembered something. WEAPCO are transporting some high level personel to Poswic.

This could be really important to our success in Sol. Sid, we'll need you to disable that ship.
FACE_SID
Agreed. Just provide me with enough cover and I'll get straight onto it.
FACE_CHRIS
We'll have to take out any communications as soon as we intercept that ship. We can't have them reporting back to WEAPCO.
