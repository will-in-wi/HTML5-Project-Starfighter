Hey, Sid, what's up?
FACE_SID
Chris, I've intercepted a communication from WEAPCO. Seems they're transporting some medical supplies around Ceradse. We need to get hold of those pods to save some lives!
FACE_CHRIS
How many do we need?
FACE_SID
All six, Chris! If you lose even a single one, thousands of people could perish in Spirit within the next few months.
