Sorry folks, we just lost our bargaining chip.
FACE_SID
Knowing how cut throat WEAPCO are I doubt it would have made a difference anyway.
FACE_CHRIS
Sol is going to be difficult. I didn't want to have to fight all the way in from the outside.
FACE_URSULA
Something else I remember is that they have a lot of heavy defenses around the outer planets.
FACE_PHOEBE

FACE_CHRIS
We'll not have much time. The longer we hang around the more time they will have to get organised before the final strike.
FACE_SID
