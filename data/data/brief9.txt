I need some resources before we leave, it'll make life a lot easier in Mordor. Problem is that the parts are proprietry of WEAPCO
FACE_PHOEBE
Can't we just salvage some from previous encounters?
FACE_SID
No, even if we manage to find them in all that space, they'll probably be too heavily damaged to be of any use.
FACE_CHRIS
We'll need to capture some WEAPCO supply craft then.
FACE_SID
Looks like I'm coming with you on this one!
