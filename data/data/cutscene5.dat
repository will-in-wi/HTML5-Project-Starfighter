FACE_PHOEBE
Will she be okay?
FACE_SID
I've had a look at the implants and they should be easy to remove. She'll just have a headache for a while.
FACE_CHRIS
Will she be able to tell us anything useful?
FACE_SID
We'll have to wait for her memory to come back. She won't remember doing anything whilst the implants were in.
FACE_SID
She'll still be able to pilot a ship though.
FACE_CHRIS
Good. The closer to Sol we get, the more resistance we'll face.

Ursula Lexx will now join you as a Wingmate. However, like Phoebe, on certain missions she will not be available.
