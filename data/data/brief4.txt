We're going to have to clear the mine field that's been building up here recently. I have a feeling that WEAPCO have deployed some miners in the area and are testing the effectiveness of the field. Removing the mines will help interplanetary traffic to start up again.

Any fighters?

Not at the moment, but that doesn't mean they won't turn up! Be very careful of those mines! They'll only explode when they encounter a ship that's not transmitting a WEAPCO signal! Shoot them down if they get in your way.
